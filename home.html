        <p id="aboutMe">
            From August 2015 to July 2016, I went to NUS Overseas College Silicon Valley. I worked as intern in Retailigence Inc for a month until they decided to restructure their company. After that, I went to another company call Appsverse Inc. I worked as full time intern for almost 10 months. I have been working for them part time since I went back to Singapore.
